<b>Source Code Documentation</b> 

A decent set of source code documentation can be generated 
by using 
<a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">Doxygen</a>.
We've cleaned up the core engine documentation
<a href="https://cvs.gnucash.org/docs/HEAD/modules.html">and 
put it online</a>.  We hope you are sutably impressed.
<br><br>
(Note there are additional developer docs in plain text and 
in texinfo formats.  What's online are just the Doxygen docs 
generated from what's embedded in the source.)
