This release includes misc bug fixes, update README files, updated german &amp;
french message translations.  I hope that I've touched the timestamps on some 
certain files so that the LIBTOOL irritation goes away.

The 1.2.2 release is meant to be a stable release for general use.

The latest experimental version is available via cvs and includes a new large 
patch to gnome from Heath Martin.
