<BR><BR>
All those who downloaded 1.2.4 can go right back and get the new version! =)
<BR>
<BR>
It fixes a rounding bug which caused 0.999 to be printed as 0.0
   instead of 1.0.  (The math was done right, it just the printing was
   broken).<BR>
<BR>
And checks & returns error when you try to save to a disk that is
   over-full.
