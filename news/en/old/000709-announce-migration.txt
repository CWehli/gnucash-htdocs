<BR><BR> The GnuCash web, ftp, and mail services are migrating to a new home.  This may cause some temporary inconveniences.  Please bear with us.

<BR><BR>
In the interim, ftp service should be available at <a href="ftp://ftp.gnucash.net/">ftp://ftp.gnucash.net/</a>, and web services should be available from <a href="ftp://www.gnucash.net/">ftp://www.gnucash.net/</a>.

<BR><BR> Things should be back to normal in a week or so, once DNS finishes propagating.

<BR><BR>
Thanks
