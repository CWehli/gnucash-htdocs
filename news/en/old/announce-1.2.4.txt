-- Is supposed to be 'stable' i.e. usable, crash-proof, not subject to
   frequent or radical change.<BR>
-- Motif-only source code. No gnome.  This should simplify builds.<BR>
-- Fixes some core dumps that 1.2.3 had.<BR>
-- Is maintained in a separate cvs branch; if you send patches to
   fix problems with this code, indicate that its for this release.<BR>
