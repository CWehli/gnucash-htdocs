2006-02-20   04:29:24
   
The GnuCash development team proudly announces GnuCash 1.9.1 aka "So we meet again", the second of several unstable 1.9.x releases of the GnuCash Open Source Accounting Software which will eventually lead to the stable version 2.0.0. This release contains many bugfixes since the first release but is still only intended for developers and adventurous testers who want to help tracking down bugs. 

<h2> What's New in GnuCash 1.9.1?</h2>
<p> o WARNING WARNING WARNING - Make sure you make backups of any files used in testing versions of GnuCash in the 1.9.x series. Although the developers go to great lengths to ensure that no data will be lost we cannot guarantee that your data will not be affected if for some reason GnuCash crashes in testing these releases.</p>
<p> o PLEASE TEST TEST AND TEST SOME MORE any and all features important to you. Then post any bugs you find to bugzilla http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=GnuCash</p>
<p> o If you have the urge to help beyond testing please get involved in the discussions on the GnuCash mailing lists which you will find at http://www.gnucash.org. We especially need people to help with updating the documentation as all texts refer currently to the 1.8.x series. Please see http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Development on how to get involved.</p>
<p> o Major bugfixes include -</p><ul>
<li> Register fixes</li>
<li> Finance::Quote issues</li>
<li> Correctly open an account and its sub-accounts.</li>
<li> Change the reports from using a hard-coded fiscal year to using the global accounting period set in the preferences. Both the start date and the end date are used, so the user is free to choose any arbitrary period.</li>
<li> Use the price nearest to midday to get the value in the default currency.</li>
<li> Make the desktop more HIG-compliant.</li>
<li> Patch to prevent crash when voiding a transaction.</li>
<li> Aqbanking updates</li>
<li> Report fixes</li>
<li> Autodetect OFX and use it if we find it.</li>
<li> Qof fixes</li></ul>
 
<h2> Caveats </h2>
<h3>Caveats for testers: </h3>
<p> Any 1.9.x version might crash unexpectedly at any point during runtime. If you test some serious work in a 1.9.x release, make sure you hit "Save" after ever non-trivial workstep. </p>
<p> Keep in mind that features which are not used in everyday work might crash unexpectedly at all times. This includes but is not limited to: graphical reports, scheduled transaction editor, price editor, financial calculator, OFX/QIF/HBCI import. </p>
<p> Especially all the new features might crash instantly on testing. This applies in particular to any of the budget-related features. We may always decide to disable such new features for the initial 2.0.0 release, and re-enable them in a later release. </p>
<p> The documentation is completely outdated. All help texts usually only refer to the 1.8.x series; please expect all descriptions in the help texts to be totally wrong when applied to the upcoming 1.9.x series. Everyone is invited to help improve the documentation; see http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Development on how to get involved. </p>
