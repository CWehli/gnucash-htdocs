<b>Announcement:</b> GnuCash 1.8.10 Release

<br>
The GnuCash team is pleased to announce the release
of stable version 1.8.10.<br><br>
<b><big>What's New in GnuCash 1.8.10?</big></b><br>
<br>
<br>
 o Don't use C++/C99 declarations.  Declare variables at the top of
 the function.<br>
 o Updated British English, Czech, Italian, Russian, German,
 Brazilian Portugese, Dutch, French, Spanish, translations.<br>
 o Fabien COELHO's zero-balance patch to remove accounts of zero
 balance from the report.<br>
 o Fix a broken recursion problem.  Don't call show-acct? from
 use-acct? so we don't recurse ad flictum.  This recursive call isn't
 necessary, just have use-acct? recurse unto itself.<br>
 o look in ${srcdir} for build-config.scm.in<br>
 o Work around problems with libltdl3.<br>
 o don't automatically try to (require 'format), so gnucash will build
 on an slib-3 system.<br>
 o Added quote sources for Indian Mutual Funds.<br>
 o Skip the case when a token is the empty string. This caused many
 warnings about a NULL kvp_frame lookup.<br>
 o Luigi Ballabio's automake patch to gnucash.m4<br>
 o guile-1.6 complains about string->symbol when passed a symbol.<br>
 o applied Vasil's patch to improve the transaction report for HTML
 export purposes.<br>
 o Backport of CVS-head changes to improve register open performance
 when working with large account trees (>500 accounts).  The new code
 caches the quickfill tree so that it is shared by all register
 windows.<br>
 o create gnc:current-saved-reports, as the file to store saved
 reports from cstim.  Autoload the saved-reports file at startup
 (after config.user/config.auto is loaded).<br>
 o Added gnc:report-generate-saved-forms that will generate the scheme
 code necessary to create a new report from the saved options of an
 old report.<br>
 o Added example Menu item "File -> Save all reports" that will call
 the new report saving function for all reports. This would need more
 work so that not all reports are saved but only the currently
 selected one -- any volunteer may feel free to add that.<br>
 o Fix saving of report: It now appends to
 ~/.gnucash/saved-reports-1.8 Statusbar tip is now more verbose.<br>
 o Add toolbar element for saving the current report.<br>
 o Add function for saving one particular report to the
 ~/.gnucash/saved-reports-1.8 file. Add extra menu only for customized
 reports.<br>
 o Remove the previous function for saving all reports since it is no
 longer necessary.<br>
 o Apply David Reiser's patch for Quicken(tm) cheques with stub.<br>
 o Apply David Grant's patch to add TD Efunds.<br>
 o make the desktop file HIG compliant.<br>
 o change the gtkhtml order to search for >= 1.1 before < 1.1, in
 order to try to fix #84707 on systems with multiple versions of
 gtkhtml.<br>
 o Perry Smith's Null Account Patch.  Make sure the security is a real
 string before appending an account separator, so we don't try to
 create a "null" account.<br>
 o Add option to include zero-amount splits in computations.<br>
 o fix xaccAccountGetBalanceAsOfDate() to properly compute the balance
 at the end of the split list.<br>
 o Major change for HBCI, back-ported from HEAD. The HBCI online
 banking is no longer based on the openhbci library but instead on the
 aqbanking library http://sf.net/projects/aqbanking which is Martin
 Preuss' successor of openhbci. This means that now aqbanking-0.9.5 is
 required instead of any openhbci package.<br>
 o Fixes for x86_64<br>
 o Update for new LibOfx, this among other things, gives gnucash
 Microsoft OFC support.<br>
 o Duplicate match tweaks in import code<br>
 o Andreas Rottmann's patch to support g-wrap 1.9.<br>
 o provide a default account name so we don't crash when someone
 imports a broken QIF that has a !Account without an account name.<br>
 o Daniel Lindenaar's patch to implement a check-box in the Invoice
 Post Dialog (with a default in the File Preferences) to choose to
 accumulate splits when posting an invoice, or post a 1:1 mapping.<br>
 o Phil Longstaff's patch to prevent duplicate pricedb entries.<br>
 o Heath Martin's x86_64 patch<br>
 o Mark search criteria for translation -- somehow this had been
 missed all the time.<br>
 o Change currency mnemonic for "New Israeli Shekel" from "ILS" to
 "NIS".<br>
 o Identified and fixed several places with untranslated strings.<br>
 o Add configure check for libofx version 0.7.0 and respective error
 message. Update docs.<br>
 o Improve importer performance by matching imported transactions only
 against transactions in the proper time interval.<br>
 o send an event when a payment is processed so the invoice gets
 updated as "paid" in the search window.<br>
 o Make sure we set the proper search-type when we create the query,
 otherwise the search will fail later.<br>

<br><br>
Available at the usual places!
