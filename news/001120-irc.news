Email got you down?  Tired of leaving a bit-trail on 
your hard drive that your boss, the IRS, the CIA or the NSA 
use against you?  Or do you merely want to flame the gnucash
developers in the most ephemeral possible way?  Then IRC
is for you: check out <b>#gnucash at irc.gnome.org</b>, where
the conversations are monitored only by the gnucash developers.
