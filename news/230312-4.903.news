2023-03-12

<h2>GnuCash 4.903 Released</h2>

<p>The GnuCash development team announces GnuCash 4.903, the fourth unstable release leading to GnuCash 5.0.</p>

<h3>This is an unstable release for testing purposes. Do not use it with production data! Make a copy of your book to test this release. </h3>
<h4>New Features</h4>
<ul>
    <li> A new Stock Transaction Assistant to guide you through entering most investment transactions for stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. You can access it from <em>Actions>Stock Assistant</em> when you have the Accounts page ora Stock or Fund account register open.</li>
    <li> A new Investment Lots report showing a graph of capital gains and losses in a period by investment lot. Note that if you don't use the View Lots dialog to manage capital gains and losses this report won't have anything to show you. Use <em>Reports>Assets & Liabilities>Investment Lots</em> to see the report.</li>
    <li>The Online Quotes facility has been completely rewritten and the old <tt>gnc-fq-check</tt>, <tt>gnc-fq-dump</tt>, and <tt>gnc-fq-helper</tt> programs have been replaced with <tt>finance-quote-wrapper</tt>. The functions performed by those programs may now be accomplished by passing commands to <tt>gnucash-cli -Q</tt>, see <tt>gnucash-cli --help</tt> for specifics. The perl module requirements have changed with the rewrite: The new version doesn't need <tt>Date::Manip</tt> but needs <tt>JSON::Parse</tt> instead. <tt>gnc-fq-update</tt> has been, er, updated to reflect that.</li>
    <li>A new tab on the New/Edit Account dialog called <em>More Properties</em> includes entries to set a high and low limit on an account. That's coupled to a new column that's available on the Accounts Page, <em>Balance Limit</em>. If you set a high or low limit and the account balance falls above or below the respective limit an indicator will be shown in the Balance Limit column.</li>
    <li>The description field quickfill in the register now displays a drop-down list of possible completions instead of just one inline completion.</li>
    <li>File import menu items for the MT940, MT942, and DTAUS formats is replaced with a single <em>Import from AQBanking</em> that supports importing any file format supported by AQBanking, including the frequently requested CAMT.</li>
    <li><p>The report generated by the Print Invoice button on the Edit Invoice tab can now be configured as a book option at the bottom of the Business tab; this permits selecting a saved configuration of one of the standard invoice reports. Another option enables a delay, during which a dialog box will appear enabling the user to select a different report.</p><p>Note: When saving a configuration make sure that the invoice number is <em>not set</em> or you'll get that particular invoice instead of the one that you pressed the button for.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/gnucash/">Help translate GnuCash on Weblate</a>. </p>
<p>Translators note that there is a new project <em>Program-beta</em> on <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/gnucash/">weblate</a> for this unstable branch. Having twice the strings causes us to exceed the free account limit, but Weblate has so far just warned us about it. If we need to change the branch we'll announce it on <em>gnucash-devel</em>.</p>
