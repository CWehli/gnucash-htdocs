<b>Preliminary Survey Results</b>
<br><br>
There have been 415 survey takers to-date. The majority of respondants
are home users interested in more home-user features.  You can view
an executive summary and the detailed responses 
<a href="/en/quiz-results.phtml">here</a>.  The survey itself
continues, and we hope to have a more detailed breakdown according
to the types of users later.
