The '<a href="links.php3">links</a>' page has been updated with
a wealth of new links to stock-tracking tools, business accounting 
packages (including our favorite, 
<a href="http://www.gnue.org">GnuE</a>), and XML format standards.
We didn't get around to listing any of the competitors to gnucash, 
mostly because we got lazy.
