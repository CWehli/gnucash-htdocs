The CVS server has fallen off the net because the 
DSL line to the CVS server has a shorting clip on it somewhere.
We are waiting for Southwestern Bell (SBC) technicians to remove 
the clip.   This is the second time in 4 months that SBC has 
sabotaged the line.  Estimated up time: 2 or 3 days.  In the meanwhile, 
please study up on CVSUP.
