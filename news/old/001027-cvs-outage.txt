CVS is back up.  The problem was
due to SBC/SWBT 'backhoe fade' (actually, a technician
with wireclippers and something against Covad).  
DSL is great when it works, but when its down, its a 
nightmare to restore service: there are an incredible number 
of layers that get involved with line testing.
