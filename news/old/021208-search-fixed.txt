<b>Search Now Works!</b>

<br>
The search feature has been fixed, and should now work.
Unfortunately, the ranking/relevence of search results
is not very good; we will be looking at other search engines
to see if we can improve this.  If you know of any spiders/
search engines with good ranking algorithms, so that e.g. they
will return main site pages before mailing list archives, 
and will rank mailing list archives by date as well as relevence,
please let me know.
