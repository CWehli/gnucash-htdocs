<b>Network Upgrade</b>

The internet connection on which www.gnucash.org and the 
gnucash.org mail servers sit will be upgraded sometime after 
the week of July 23. The new line will have 
more bandwidth, which should speed transfers.  Note that
the IP address of the website will be changing.  This change
should be transparent to everyone; however, if you have trouble
accessing this site after that date, you may want to try to flush 
your domain name cache.
