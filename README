# Notes for those editing these pages.
#
# all pages must call emulate_globals_on.php to bring in
# gettext support.
#
# Within content, the absolute rules are:
# 1. If you OPEN a tag, YOU are responsible for closing it
# 2. Escape all entities: use &amp; &lt; &gt; - watch those
# Bugzilla or SourceForge URL links: all query strings need to
# use &amp;
#
# Setup

# This section will be improved as more mirrors come into use.
# 
# Your DocumentRoot should be <path to checkout>/htdocs/www
# Files in htdocs/ should NOT be visible on your website!


# i18n and l10n:
# =============
# 
# The server needs to be configured for the underlying locales
# before PHP can use gettext to translate them. On Debian,
# install and configure 'locales' for each supported language
# and use 'dpkg-reconfigure locales' to add new ones later.
# 
# The test server at http://gnucash.neil.williamsleesmill.me.uk/
# supports: C POSIX de_DE de_DE.iso88591 de_DE.utf8 deutsch dutch
# en_AU en_AU.iso88591 en_AU.utf8 en_BW en_BW.iso88591 en_BW.utf8
# en_CA en_CA.iso88591 en_CA.utf8 en_GB en_GB.iso88591 en_GB.utf8
# en_US en_US.iso88591 en_US.utf8 es_ES es_ES.iso88591 es_ES.utf8
# fr_FR fr_FR.iso88591 fr_FR.utf8 français french german it_IT
# it_IT.iso88591 it_IT.utf8 italian nl_NL nl_NL.iso88591 nl_NL.utf8

# The aim is that all translatable content is in either www/ or news/
# and all translation files are in htdocs/ and po/. Other directories will be
# gradually removed. In particular, www/ and news/ will not need
# to contain separate directories for each supported language. Scripts will
# then update the gnucash-htdocs.pot file, merge updated messages with available
# translations and create binary translation files in relevant LC_MESSAGES locations
# ready for a commit.
#
# Preparing translations:
# =======================
# 
# ./create-potfiles.pl > po/POTFILES
# ./make-pot.sh

# Now merge the new content into your translation, substituting the name of 
# your po file in the command:

# msgmerge po/en_GB.po po/gnucash-htdocs.pot -o po/en_GB.po

# Finally, see the size of the task ahead:

# msgfmt -c --statistics po/en_GB.po

# Whilst editing the translation, run the msgfmt command from time to time to catch
# errors and let you know how much is left to do.

# When you come across fuzzy markers: (#, fuzzy), remove them.

# When you have no fuzzy and no untranslated messages, update the binary translation file:

msgfmt po/en_GB.po -o en_GB/LC_MESSAGES/gnucash-htdocs.mo

# Again, substitute your language in the name of the po file and the installed directory.
