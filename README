TODO:
- should externals/gnucash.css reference "../images/webding.png"?

Notes about multi-lingual gnucash website content.

- all pages must call lang.php to bring in gettext support.

- It would be nice to use the same containing structure for all translations.
- Phrase content can probably be po-style translated well.
- Body/paragraph content probably wants to be block-replaced.
- We're fine not doing auto-language negotiation.

----------------------------------------

$top_dir := the relative reference to the top of the relative website; this
  should be used for language-independent resources (stylesheets, images, php
  includes), but not for links...

$home := a prefix for URLs; for everything but lists.gnucash.org, this'll
  be ".", but for lists.gnucash.org it'll be "http://www.gnucash.org/".

Preparing translations
----------------------

    $ ./create-potfiles.pl > po/POTFILES
    $ ./make-pot.sh

Now merge the new content into your translation, substituting the name of 
your po file in the command:

    $ msgmerge po/en_GB.po po/gnucash-htdocs.pot -o po/en_GB.po

Finally, see the size of the task ahead:

    $ msgfmt -c --statistics po/en_GB.po

Whilst editing the translation, run the msgfmt command from time to time to catch
errors and let you know how much is left to do.

When you come across fuzzy markers: (#, fuzzy), remove them.

When you have no fuzzy and no untranslated messages, update the binary translation file:

    $ msgfmt po/en_GB.po -o en_GB/LC_MESSAGES/gnucash-htdocs.mo
