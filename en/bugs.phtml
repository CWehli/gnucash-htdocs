<h1>GnuCash Bugs at GNOME Bugzilla</h1>

<p>
The GnuCash bug reporting system is now hosted by GNOME bugzilla.
This gives the GnuCash project the ability to receive bug reports 
generated by Bug Buddy as well as take advantage of the GNOME bug 
team in their overall administration of GNOME bugs.
</p>
<p>
If you wish to use the GNOME bug system to report a GnuCash bug,
please go to <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org">bugzilla.gnome.org</a> 
and use the forms there to enter your report.<br>

   (Yes, there are a lot of these. We need help from someone to weed out
   the ones that can't be reproduced, that don't have enough info in them 
   to do anything with, and those that are duplicates of one another.
   You don't need to be a programmer to help with the above tasks.
   Finally, we do need programmers to help start fixing some of these.
   Please volunteer your time!)
