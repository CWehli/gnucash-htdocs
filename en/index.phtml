<h1>Welcome to GnuCash.org</h1>
  
<font size=-1>
If you've been looking for a way to manage your personal finances using Free Software, you've
found it! Designed to be easy to use, yet powerful and flexible, GnuCash allows you to track bank
accounts, stocks, income and expenses. As quick and intuitive to use as a checkbook register, it
is based on professional accounting principles to ensure balanced books and accurate reports.
GnuCash is backed by an active development community and is blossoming into a full-fledged
accounting system. Developed under the GPL, you have no need to worry about obsolescence:
GnuCash will be there for you. 
<br><br>
This web site is devoted to promoting the Gnucash.org software development project. We are
committed to developing top-notch accounting and financial tools for GNU/Linux and Unix 
users. This includes the development of programming API's, libraries and components that 
can be used to create both server and personal applications for home and business use. 
By focusing on ease-of-use, modular design, architected interfaces and well-documented 
code, we hope that GnuCash and its associated financial libraries become the choice of 
a GNU generation of programmers and users.
<br><br>
Yes, GnuCash now runs on Mac OSX, as well as GNU/Linux, *BSD, and the
traditional Unixes: Solaris, AIX, and so on.
