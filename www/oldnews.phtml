My goal is to have very very little code for this: mostly, a specification of the SQL tables, and a mapping: 'this business object field goes into that sql field', and that's that.  The goal/side effect is that this should make adding new objects to GnuCash backend 'real easy'. Depending on how the above goes, I may or may not convert the existing sql backend to use this new system.

<?php echo _("The GnuCash.org Server is back online, and should now be fully operational. However, there has been some data loss: if you subscribed (or unsubscribed) to any mailing list, between 12 December 2002 and 28 April 2003, your membership info has been lost. Furthermore, <b>all</b> configuration info for the German <tt>gnucash-de</tt> mailing list has been lost. (My sincerest apologies, Christian).  However, most of the mailing list archives should be intact (possibly excepting Jan-April 2003, which might be damaged).  All web pages should work at least as well as before, and all FTP site contents have been restored and should be fine. If you experience problems, please report them to me. <b>Mail is still not being delivered; investigating</b>");?>
<br><br>
<b><i><?php echo _("So what happened?");?></i></b>  
<?php echo _("It was the classic server-failure triple-whammy. This server has RAID disk mirrors to minimize down-time due to a failed disk, and is backed up nightly in order to safeguard against catastrophic data loss.  Hard-drive status was monitored with <tt>smartmontools</tt> and reported regularly with <tt>logcheck</tt>. So how could this belt-and-suspenders system be down so long, and result in lost data before its all over?");?>
<br><br>
<?php echo _("Over the last few months, <tt>smartmontools</tt> was reporting occasional disk status changes, but none of these seemed to be in the form of warnings, or had any hint of being dire. At the same time, there were increasing numbers of <tt>status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }</tt> messages showing up in the system log.  In mid-April, these messages started showing up at least hourly, and were coupled with the cryptic S.M.A.R.T. messages (it didn't help that I was running the older, more cryptic <tt>smartsuite</tt>, not the new, improved <tt>smartmontools</tt>).  Finally, the server locked up, waiting for a DMA to complete, that never would.  Reboot. Locks up. Reboot again, locks up (warlord calls by phone to point this out). I disabled DMA, went to PIO-mode for the disk in question, and things cleared up. I then made my first thinko: I concluded that one of my hard drives was on the verge of failing completely (the DMA should have clue-trained me in).");
echo _("I procured a replacement disk, and then made my second 'operator error':  I replaced the failing disk. My logic was this:  there are two disks in the raid array; both are exact duplicates of each other.  Therefore, if I replace the failed disk, the contents of the good disk will be restored onto the blank disk automatically. Easy as pie.  I've done it many times before.   It didn't work this time. Upon reboot, I got a gazillion <tt>fsck</tt>'ing errors, the file system was corrupted. In addition, I was getting a <i>lot</i> of <tt>status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }</tt> from what used to be the 'good' disk. I ploughed on.");
echo _("At this time, I assumed that maybe both disks were bad, a reasonable assumption; these were the infamous IBM-lawsuit drives. I guessed that the raid array was hiding the badness from me: whenever one disk had trouble, the RAID would go to the other disk, and all was well in the kingdom, even though anarchy seethed just below the surface. Oh well.  I procured a second hard drive, and replaced that.  With more <tt>fsck</tt>'ing error in the process.  Then I notice that I'm still getting SeekComplete's in the syslog, even with the new disks. Now, the replacement disks are the same lawsuit-brand and model number as the old disks, so woe is me, this is my third mistake, I assume, incorrectly, that its the brand and model number, and get a new third disk.  When the errors don't abate, it suddenly becomes clear that its not the drives, its the controller or cable).");?>
<br><br>
<?php echo _("Now the fun and hacking begin.  Stay up til three AM playing the swap-the-cables-and-reboot game.  The failing controller was on the system planar ('motherboard'), so there is no way to remove it; one can only play with BIOS settings. But BIOS (and the Linux kernel shares the blame) has this magic way of renumbering IDE drives when one plugs in or removes controllers, enables or disables controller ports, etc.  This can be overcome, but is a provides a steady stream of hurdles to jump: one must boot a rescue diskette first, then mount, then re-write the boot sector, then reboot, then edit <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>, and then try again. Over and over and over. It didn't help that my rescue diskette didn't have RAID on it: so that was one more thing to hack around.   Finally build a stable system, and now it comes time to restore the data files that were <tt>fsck</tt>'ed out of existence.  To restore <tt>/usr</tt>, I decide that reinstall of the OS is appropriate. I then restore the FTP site, which was badly corrupted.");
echo _("Restore the mailing lists; no problems, only October 1998 was lost and restored.  Restore the website; only minor damage there. Then restore the mailing list subscriber info in <tt>/var/lib/mailman/lists</tt> ... Uhh ... whoops.  That directory was <i>not</i> backed up nightly.   I had falsely assumed that everything in <tt>/var/lib/mailman/lists</tt> was stuff that could be recovered by re-installing <tt>mailman</tt>.  I had no idea that it kept subscriber info there.  Mistake number four (number zero?): this critical directory was not one that was backed up nightly. I was lucky to find a December 2002 backup of it;  it could  have easily been December 2001 and then I really would have felt sorry.");
echo _("Mistake five: turns out the backup machine had overflowed, and stopped making backups on 5 April.  Fortunately for me, not much has happened since 5 April.   I hope this little story makes it clear that running a public web site in a professional manner can sometimes be a walk in the park, and sometimes guerilla warfare. BTW, yes, every now and then, this server is backed up to an off-site location, so that if the machine is stolen, or the house burns down, all is not lost.");?>

 o Use invoice's currency for printing the invoice.<br>
 o Make the progress bar argument a double instead of an int.  This
   gets around an issue with guile 1.6.<br>
 o Add a checkbox to search-for-all<br>
 o Changes to make the build system work on multiple architectures and
   with multiple versions of the autotools suite.  Make generated g-wrap
   sources depend on config.status.<br>
 o Remove restriction on guile versions > 1.4 Provide a version
   dependant load path variable for the SRFI location. (Empty in 1.6
   since they're bundled with guile.)<br>
 o Limit QIF matches against only the accounts in the old group, so we
   don't match against ourselves.  This should limit the matches to only
   "reasonable" matches.<br>
 o Remove "user name" and "user address" preferences, as they are no
   longer used by anything.<br>
 o Create a taxtable option type using the new generic optionmenu code
 o Create a default customer and default vendor taxtable option for
   the "File Properties" option menu.<br>
 o Reset the search-type to "New Search" if we end up displaying no
   results.<br>
 o Use the "New Search Limit" pref to decide when to start a new
   search vs. when refine the search.<br>
 o Create two new global preferences: "Notify Bills Due?" and "Bills
   Due Days"<br>
 o Added sources needed for OS X to dist.<br>
 o Lots more bugfixes<br>

<br>
 o Welcome to Release Candidate 2<br>

 o Fixes to Postgresql backend.<br>

 o Implement unpost function in invoices.<br>
 o Correctly open a help window when the initial URL contains a label
   component to it.<br>

   backend. This is an option in the preferences.<br>
 o Provide a simple checkbook set of accounts<br>
 o When editing an exchange rate, always change the _VALUE_ of the

 o Give a much higher importance to the date heuristics in the OFX
   import. <br>

</div><div class="newsinner">
<br><br>
GnoTime, the Gnome Time Tracker, is a to-do list
manager.  It has a built in project timer to keep 
track of the time spent on a project, and an invoicing
system for billing time &amp; services.

GnoTime is the Gnome2 port of GTT from the 
gnome-utils package.  

It now has its own dedicated
<a href="http://gttr.sourceforge.net">
web page</a> and 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gttr/">
sourceforge project site</a>.
<br><br>
We are proud to announce the first 'stable'
release of Gnotime: version 2.1.1.  It
is available for download at the above sites.

This version does everything that the 
gnome-utils-1.4 version did, except that
it has a few more features and a few less bugs.
In particular, the crash problems that plagued
the earlier version are now fixed.

 o Put the build date into the about box for development versions<br>
 o Deal with broken QIF files that give broken bang-fields. In

    context menu<br>

    "amount" in the the local (register) currency.<br>

    before attempting to call Finance::Quote.<br>

 o Filled in a long-thought of idea for a formula cell: can contain
    text unlike a pricecell, but doesn't really want to do
       auto-complete like a quickfill cell [what we had been using].  This
          allows us to provide the gnome formula cell which can remap the
	     keypad '.' character based on locale<br>
 o Disallow the deletion of accounts with ReadOnly Transacation in
    them. You must first "delete" the RO Txns before you delete the
       account.<br>

The next stable release, 1.8.0, is rapidly approaching, and we need

Version 1.8.0 will be based on the development versions 1.7.x,
which contain many new features not in 1.6.x, and thus many
new strings that need translation.
If these translations are not brought up to date, version 1.8.0
will come out with broken or missing translations for many languages.
Now is really the best time to bring translations up to date.

 - <b>2002-10-28   13:50:59
</b>
</div><div class="newsinner">
The GnuCash team is pleased to announce the release of the second alpha
version 1.7.2: "Antipodean Nightmare".
This release is the result of the development team working so hard the
GnuCash developers topped the GNOME Summary commits list last week.
<ul>
<li>New Features in this version!</li>
<li>You can now search by reconcile flag for transactions</li>
<li>Ability to set posted invoices and payments read-only in the small   
business module.</li>
<li>New commodity matcher for OFX generic import.</li>
<li>Latest libofx is needed for OFX support</li>
<li>Investment transactions now create two accounts, one is for the
stock, the other is the account defined by the FI, where the
cash is swapped.</li>
<li>Updated glossary</li>
<li>HBCI improvements to transaction retrieval</li>
<li>Add Direct Debit HBCI action and add caching of the
PIN to user preferences.</li>
<li>HBCI suport requires OpenHBCI 0.9.3 or current OpenHBCI CVS</li>
<li>Loads of bugfixes, keep those bugs coming!</li>
<li>NOTE: Report bugs to bugzilla.gnome.org</li>
</ul><p>
This release features HBCI online banking support. This makes it the
world's first *free* HBCI-enabled personal finance manager.
</p><p>
HBCI (Home Banking Computer Interface) is a standard used by German
banks for offering online banking service. Through this standard,
business actions like statement retrieval, bank transfer, or direct
debits can be invoked by any HBCI-compliant client application, i.e. now
also from GnuCash. Authentification and encryption is done through a
bank-issued chip card or a self-generated file-based RSA key pair. (In
the latter case, the user prints out his public key finger print on
paper, signs it, and sends it to his bank.)

</div><div class="newsinner">
<BR><BR>
The next stable release, 1.6.0, is rapidly approaching, and we need
all language translators to update the message catalogs. 
The translatable text strings in 1.5.x have been frozen, we don't 
expect any new strings in 1.6.0.  However, the text strings in 
the current 1.5.x are completely different from those in 1.4.12,
and many new strings have been added since he earlier days of 1.5.x.
If these translations are not brought up to date, version 1.6.0
will come out with broken or missing translations for many languages.
Now is really the best time to bring translations up to date.

</div><div class="newsinner">
<BR><BR>
<a href="http://www.gnumatic.com">Gnumatic Incorporated</a> 
 is pleased to announce its formal support for GnuCash!
 Gnumatic is a company that was created expressly to 
 further develop and enhance GnuCash, to broaden its 
 availability, and to provide formal, for-fee support
 to customers that need a strong corporate backer.
 <br><br>
 Who's Gnumatic, you may ask?  Well, some of the voices
 you already know from the mailing list are a part of 
 Gnumatic: rlb, grib, dave@krondo, rgmerk, linas, and,
 hopefully, soon, others. 
 <br><br>
 What does corporate support mean?  Well, we hope that
 it means only positive things: more features, more 
 functions, faster and with less bugs.  We hope that
 it means that GnuCash will have a rosy long-term 
 future to become the premier accounting package on 
 Linux.  We hope that it establishes the GPL as the
 only viable long-term licensing model for desktop 
 software.  And finally, we hope that GnuCash can 
 spin off and excite a number of
 projects that will further enhance the state of 
 financial software on Linux.
 <br><br>
 We're pretty excited, and we hope that you will be too!

Please be aware that the 1.5 series of GnuCash is a
<em> development</em> release. This means you can expect instabilities and dependency problems as we add features and use newer libraries.  If you just want to use GnuCash and not worry about having the latest features and bugs, you should use the 1.4 series.
